# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java (CS61B)

Solutions to weekly labs and major projects from auditing [CS61B](https://fa23.datastructur.es/), Berkley's data structures and algorithms unit. Learned a **ton**.

Quote from the course that captures its essence:
> An engineer can do for a dime, what any fool can do for a dollar.

## Highlights
### Project 1: Dequeue
Implemented two different dequeue data structures (list and array based), as well as an interface to abstract underlying details.

### Project 2: Gitlet (incomplete)
Implented a simple version control system based on Git.

## Focuses of the course:
### 1. Software engineering
  - Decomposing difficult problems
  - Managing complexity in large systems
  - Testing
  - Debugging

### 2. Algorithms and data structures
  - Know how to build fundamental data structures
  - Understand import algorithms and the trade-offs they make
  - Runtime analysis
